# Ruslan Kovalenko PHP / Symfony / Laravel / JS Code samples

Hello there!
This is the repository for my code examples.
Most folders have a README file containing basic information about the sample code and its main ideas.

Please check my links to get more information about me:
- [Upwork](https://upwork.com/freelancers/~01131138d36f4e60b9)
- [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/ruslanix)

P.S. Perhaps some of the code is out of date, but I don't want to delete it for the sake of preserving history.
